// A passenger can summon the lift to go up or down from any floor, once in the lift they can choose the floor theyâ€™d like to travel to.

// Your program needs to plan the optimal set of instructions for the lift to travel, stop, and open its doors.

// Some test cases:

// Passenger summons lift on the ground floor. Once in, choose to go to level 5.

// Passenger summons lift on level 6 to go down. Passenger on level 4 summons the lift to go down. They both choose L1.

// Passenger 1 summons lift to go up from L2. Passenger 2 summons lift to go down from L4. Passenger 1 chooses to go to L6. Passenger 2 chooses to go to Ground Floor

// Passenger 1 summons lift to go up from Ground. They choose L5. Passenger 2 summons lift to go down from L4. Passenger 3 summons lift to go down from L10. Passengers 2 and 3 choose to travel to Ground.

// -- Thought process --
// want instructions to be: elevator = {passengers: [p1, p2, p3, p4, p5], level: 0, currentDirection: up}
// display passengers and level to show p3 picked up, up, stop, diplay passengers and level to show p4 picked up,
// up, stop, diplay passengers and level(4) p4 now gone, up, stop, diplay passengers and level (6) p3 now gone (empty),
// up, diplay passengers and level(10) p2 on, down, stop, diplay passengers and level(5) p2, p1, down, stop diplay passengers and level (empty, 0)

// {passengers: [p3], level: 0, currentDirection: up} <-- always starts on up and level 0
// direction
// {passengers: [p3, p4], level: 1, currentDirection: up}
// direction
// {passengers: [p3], level: 4, currentDirection: up}
// direction
// {passengers: [], level: 6, currentDirection: up}
// direction
// {passengers: [p2], level: 10, currentDirection: down}
// direction
// {passengers: [p2, p1], level: 5, currentDirection: down}
// direction
// {passengers: [], level: 0, currentDirection: down} <-- ends with no passengers and whatever level was last and direction

// check if elevator level & direction match passenger, pick them up, otherwise next
// check each level if current passengers has destination
